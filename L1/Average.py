# There are five trees in Jack's front yard. He checks each tree to find out how tall it is in inches and writes the height on a sheet of paper. Jack's list: 98, 94, 41, 96, and 11. What is the average height of a tree in Jack's front yard?

# Storing Values
tree1 = 98
tree2 = 45
tree3 = 64
tree4 = 53
tree5 = 165

# Finding the total of trees 
sum = tree1 + tree2 + tree3 + tree4 + tree5
print("The sum of all 5 trees is: ", sum)

# Finding the average of trees
average = sum/5
print("The average of all the trees are:", average)
