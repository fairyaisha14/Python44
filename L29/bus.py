#Write a Python program to implement Inheritance by creating a Parent Class Vehicle with a constructor that has details like name, maximum speed, and mileage. Then, create a Child Class Bus that inherits Class Vehicle. Finally, showcase Inheritance to display the details of the Vehicle Bus named - School Volvo.

class Vehicle:

    def __init__(self, name, max_speed, mileage):
        self.name = name
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.mileage = mileage

class Bus(Vehicle):
    pass

School_bus = Bus("School Volvo", 180, 12)
print("Vehicle Name:", School_bus.name, "Speed", School_bus.max_speed, "Milage:", School_bus.mileage)
